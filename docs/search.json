Note that users must ensure that the selected categories exist in BOTH Waste Rock input files. If one input file does not contain the selected category, the tool will return an error.\r\nStep 4: Enter Percentage\r\nThe tool uses percentage to determine whether there is a difference between the base case and application case. If the Waste Rock in the application case was zero while the base case values were non-zero, the percentage would be 100%. The percentage equation is as follows:\r\n\\[\r\n                 \\frac{WR_{Application~base}-WR_{Base~case}}{WR_{Base~case}}\r\n\\]\r\nStep 5: Enter Column Range and Row of RWQM ID\r\nEnter the range of headers in the Waste Rock input file. For example, if the range of headers in the Excel sheet for FRO is A7:AY7, enter “A:AY” for the column range and “7” for the row range.\r\nStep 6: Process, Download Data, and Visualization\r\nPress the “Process Data” button. After processing the tables, users can download the results as a .CSV file. A new section will appear in the sidebar where users can select one category to visualize the processed data. For cumulative Waste Rock, the tool provides an area plot, while the rest of the plots are lollipop plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If you have a larger dataset, please contact me directly.\r\nStep 1: Upload the Files\r\nIn the “Browse” section, upload your EQuals.xlsx file.\r\nStep 2: Select the Fraction\r\nThe fraction value is used to compile repeated samples at the same time step that have both “above detection” (i.e., above the detection limit) and “non-detection” (i.e., lower than the detection limit) results. The equation is as follows:\r\n\\[\r\nY_{final~value}=X_{above~detection}+\\alpha_{fraction}×X_{non~detection}\r\n\\]\r\nStep 3: Select SYS_LOC_CODE (Nodes)\r\nThe option for nodes will be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. You can select multiple nodes if you need to process more than one node.\r\nStep 4: Select Chemicals (Constituents)\r\nThe option for constituents will be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. The tool will process the constituents that are in our list. Flows, temperature, etc., will be removed from the options.\r\nStep 5: Select Time Step\r\nThe tool provides the option to convert the daily average to weekly, monthly, and yearly averages. If you require custom statistical methods, please contact me.\r\nStep 6: Process the Data\r\nAfter selecting all the sections above, press the “Process” button to start processing your data.\r\nStep 7: Download the Dataset\r\nThis tool allows you to download the processed data. If you press the button, please wait a few minutes for a new window to appear, allowing you to select the download location on your PC, as the backstage is busy processing the data.\r\nStep 8: Visualize the Processed Data\r\nAfter processing the data, a new section will appear that allows users to visualize the processed data in the tool. Currently, the tool supports one node with multiple constituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
