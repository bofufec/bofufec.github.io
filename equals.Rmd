## Pre-treatment

The EQuals compilation tool is designed for .xlsx files that are less than 50 MB. If you have a larger dataset, please contact me directly.

## Step 1: Upload the Files

In the "Browse" section, upload your EQuals.xlsx file.

## Step 2: Select the Fraction

The fraction value is used to compile repeated samples at the same time step that have both "above detection" (i.e., above the detection limit) and "non-detection" (i.e., lower than the detection limit) results. The equation is as follows:

$$
Y_{final~value}=X_{above~detection}+\alpha_{fraction}Ã—X_{non~detection}
$$

## Step 3: Select SYS_LOC_CODE (Nodes)

The option for nodes will be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. You can select multiple nodes if you need to process more than one node.

## Step 4: Select Chemicals (Constituents)

The option for constituents will be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. The tool will process the constituents that are in our list. Flows, temperature, etc., will be removed from the options.

## Step 5: Select Time Step

The tool provides the option to convert the daily average to weekly, monthly, and yearly averages. If you require custom statistical methods, please contact me.

## Step 6: Process the Data

After selecting all the sections above, press the "Process" button to start processing your data.

## Step 7: Download the Dataset

This tool allows you to download the processed data. If you press the button, please wait a few minutes for a new window to appear, allowing you to select the download location on your PC, as the backstage is busy processing the data.

## Step 8: Visualize the Processed Data

After processing the data, a new section will appear that allows users to visualize the processed data in the tool. Currently, the tool supports one node with multiple constituents.
