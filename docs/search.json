Select the CPUs\r\nThe tool is able to use parallel running (multiple cores) to speed up the calculation. Usually, one core would take charge of the calculation in one watershed. Therefore, the recommend CPUs number is equal to the number of selected watersheds.\r\nStep 2. Upload the base- and application-case waste rock\r\nUpload the area input files to base case and application case\r\nStep 3. Select watersheds\r\nPlease select watersheds\r\nStep 4. Enter comparison tolerance\r\nAbove comparison tolerance (i.e., abs|base case-application case|) would be regarded as difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Upload the files\r\nPlease the Browse section to upload your EQuals.xlsx file.\r\nStep 2. Select the fraction\r\nFraction value is used to compile the repeated samples at the same time step which have both “above detection”(i.e., above detection limit) and “non-detection”(i.e., lower than detection limit). The equation is as below:\r\n\\[\r\nY_{final~value}=X_{above~dection}+\\alpha_{fraction}×X_{non~detction}\r\n\\]\r\nStep 3. Select SYS_LOC_CODE (nodes)\r\nThe option of nodes would be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. You can select multiple nodes if you need process more than one nodes.\r\nStep 4. Select chemicals (constituents)\r\nThe option of constituents would be auto-generated after uploading your EQuals file. The tool processed the constituents which are in our list. In other words, flows, temperature and etc. would be removed in the option.\r\nStep 5. Select time step\r\nThe tool provides the option to convert the daily average to weekly, monthly and yearly average. If you need some customized statistical methods, please reach out to me.\r\nStep 6. Process the data\r\nAfter selecting all above sections, press the “Process” button to start processin your data.\r\nStep 7. Download the dataset\r\nThis tool allows to download the processed data. If you press the button, you may need to wait a couple of minutes to get the new windows to select download location in your PC, because the backstage is busy in processing the data.\r\nStep 8. Visualize the processed data\r\nAfter processing the data, a new section would appear which allows users to visulize the process data in this tool. Now, the tool supports ONE node with mutiple consituents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Enter categories\r\nPlease enter the categories of WR. It is noted that, users need to check if there is select categories in BOTH WR input files. If one input file does not contain the selected category, the tool would return an error.\r\nStep 4. Enter percentage\r\nThe tool use percentage to tell whether there is difference between the base case and application case. It is noted that, if WR in case was zero while application values were non-zero, the percentage would be 100%. The equation of percentage is shown as below:\r\n\\[\r\n                 WR_{Application~base}-WR_{Base~case}\\over WR_{Base~case}\r\n\\]\r\nStep 5. Enter column range and row of RWQM ID\r\nPlease enter the range of headers in WR input file. For example, in FRO the range of headers in Excel sheet is A7:AY7. So, enter “A:AY”to column range and “7” to row range.\r\nStep 6. Process & download data and visualization\r\nPress “Process Data”. After processing the tables, users can download the results as a .CSV file. A new section would appear at the sidebar, users can select one categories to visualize the processed data. For cumulative WR, the tool provide area plot while rest of plot are lollipop plots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
